# Why You Should Think Twice Before Using External Libraries

In the modern software development landscape, the use of external libraries is almost ubiquitous. Libraries offer convenience, save development time, and provide reusable code for common tasks. However, while libraries can be extremely useful, there are several reasons why developers should be cautious about their adoption. In this article, we explore the drawbacks of using external libraries and why it's sometimes better to build your own solutions.

## 1. **Increased Code Bloat**

One of the most immediate drawbacks of using external libraries is the increase in your application's size. Libraries often come with more code than you need, introducing unnecessary functions and features. This "code bloat" can slow down your application, especially if the library includes functionality you're not using, or it might increase the size of your deployment.

As your project grows, you may find yourself relying on libraries that contribute more weight than value, making your application harder to maintain and slower to load. This is especially problematic in environments like mobile or embedded systems where resource optimization is critical.

## 2. **Security Risks**

External libraries, especially those sourced from open-source repositories, can introduce security vulnerabilities. While the open-source community often reviews and patches these libraries, the speed at which security flaws are discovered and fixed can vary. Relying on libraries means you are indirectly trusting the maintainers to address potential vulnerabilities.

If a library you're using is abandoned or no longer actively maintained, you could face additional risks. Outdated libraries may not receive the latest security patches, leaving your application exposed to attacks.

## 3. **Dependency Management Complexity**

When you integrate third-party libraries, you introduce dependencies that must be managed and kept up-to-date. Over time, these dependencies can become tangled, especially if they rely on other libraries that have their own dependencies. This can lead to version conflicts, where different libraries require different versions of the same dependency, leading to compatibility issues.

Managing these dependencies becomes a complex task, particularly in large projects, and in some cases, you might find yourself spending more time solving dependency issues than actually building features.

## 4. **Reduced Flexibility and Customization**

Libraries are designed to be general solutions, but your application may require more specific functionality. Relying too heavily on external libraries can limit your flexibility. You might end up trying to work within the constraints of a library, even if it doesn't perfectly match your needs. Making changes to the underlying library can be difficult, and modifying it to fit your requirements could lead to maintenance headaches down the road.

Customizing third-party code can sometimes be harder than writing your own solution from scratch, especially when you need to implement specialized features or have unique business logic.

## 5. **Performance Overhead**

Many libraries introduce performance overhead due to the additional code they carry. This can be especially problematic if your application needs to perform resource-intensive tasks. Some libraries may not be optimized for your use case, leading to slower execution times and higher memory usage. For applications where performance is crucial, such as real-time systems or high-load web services, this overhead can be a significant concern.

## 6. **Long-Term Maintenance Issues**

External libraries, particularly those that are no longer actively maintained, can become a liability over time. When a library is abandoned by its creators or its updates become infrequent, you are left with the risk of using outdated or unsupported code. In some cases, libraries may become incompatible with newer versions of programming languages or frameworks, requiring you to either find an alternative or fork and maintain the library yourself.

Additionally, if you are using multiple libraries, you may face issues when upgrading to newer versions of the libraries or when they stop being supported altogether. This can create a considerable amount of technical debt that needs to be managed.

## 7. **License Issues**

Not all libraries are free to use, and even when they are open-source, you need to be cautious of the licenses they use. Some licenses may impose restrictions on how the code can be used, modified, or distributed. If you're building a commercial product, using libraries with restrictive licenses can introduce legal complications.

Before incorporating a third-party library into your project, it’s important to review its licensing terms carefully to ensure that it aligns with your goals and business requirements.

## 8. **Knowledge and Dependency on External Teams**

Relying on external libraries often means relying on other teams and communities to fix bugs, provide updates, and add features. This introduces an element of uncertainty, as the library may no longer be actively maintained or supported. If you encounter a bug or a need for a new feature, you might be at the mercy of external maintainers to address the issue.

Moreover, if your team lacks deep knowledge of the libraries you're using, troubleshooting problems in those libraries can be difficult and time-consuming. It’s easy to get into a situation where your team is not familiar with the internals of the libraries, making it harder to identify and resolve issues.

## Conclusion: Striking the Right Balance

External libraries can be incredibly useful, but they should not be used without careful consideration. It's important to strike a balance between leveraging the power of existing solutions and maintaining control over the codebase. When choosing whether to use a library, carefully assess the benefits, risks, and long-term implications. In some cases, it might be more beneficial to write custom code or rely on well-maintained, minimal dependencies that fit your needs exactly.

By understanding the potential pitfalls and exercising caution, developers can avoid the common mistakes associated with over-relying on external libraries and ensure that their applications are secure, maintainable, and optimized for performance.
